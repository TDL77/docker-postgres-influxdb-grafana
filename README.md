# docker-postgres-influxdb-grafana

This repo provides a quick guide of how to configure a dashboard environment from
[Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), Postgres and InfluxDB and build animated maps using 
[GeoLoop Panel](https://github.com/CitiLogics/citilogics-geoloop-panel) plugin.

## GeoLoop Panel Example

The following animation shows the total number of active Covid-19 cases reported in each country
at each point of time. Active cases = total confirmed - total recovered - total deaths.

## Quick Start

To start the application, install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 
on the host, clone this repo and run docker-compose from the [docker](/docker) directory.

```
$ cd docker && docker-compose up -d

Starting influx   ... done
Starting postgres ... done
Starting grafana  ... done

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       PORTS                    NAMES
e00c0bd0d4a5        grafana/grafana:latest      0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   grafana
2b33999d97b3        influxdb:latest             0.0.0.0:8086->8086/tcp   influx
c4453cac69eb        postgres:latest             0.0.0.0:5433->5432/tcp   postgres
```

Three containers have been created and started. For the app services we expose the following ports: 
3000 (grafana), 8086 (influx), 5432 (postgres). Note that we use `HOST:CONTAINER` mapping when specifying
postgres ports in docker-compose file. Inside a docker container, postgres is running on port `5432`, whereas the publicly exposed port
outside the container is `5433`. 

```
version: '3'

services:
  postgres:
    ports:
      - "5433:5432"
```

Before we login to Grafana UI, we need to create PostgreSQL database. Note that we have already created InfluxDB
database specifying `ÃŒNFLUXDB_DB` environment variable in docker-compose file.

To create postgres database we use [psql](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html), Postgres interactive terminal.
Check [Makefile](/docker/Makefile) for more details.

```
$ make -C docker/ create-database
$ make -C docker/ init-schema
```

Now we can login to the Grafana web UI in browser (http://localhost:3000/grafana/) with the login `admin` and 
password `password`.

## Data Sources

Before we create a dashboard, we need to add InfluxDB and PostgreSQL data sources.
Follow [this guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/features/datasources/add-a-data-source/) to find out
how to do this.

Here is the configuration parameters we use to add InfluxDB data source.

This is the configuration parameters we use to add PostgreSQL data source.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viktorsapozhok/docker-postgres-influxdb-grafana/master/docs/images/postgres.png" width="720">

The valid password for both data sources is `password`. You can change the credentials in [docker/.env](/docker/.env) file
before starting the service via `docker-compose up`.

## Populating the database

To illustrate the process of building the animated map with GeoLoop Panel plugin, we will use time series data
tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 worldwide, including confirmed cases of Coronavirus infection, 
the number of people died while sick with Coronavirus, the number of people recovered from it.

We read data from [this repo](https://datahub.io/core/covid-19) and write it to three postgres tables: 

* countries_aggregated - cumulative cases across the globe.
* us_aggregated - cumulative cases for US regions.
* countries_ref - regions metadata.

To list all the tables in the database we need to login to the database via terminal.

```
$ psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U postgres -d grafana
```

And list all tables within schema `covid`.

```
grafana=# \dt+ covid.*
                            List of relations
 Schema |         Name         | Type  |  Owner   |  Size   | Description 
--------+----------------------+-------+----------+---------+-------------
 covid  | countries_aggregated | table | postgres | 4136 kB | 
 covid  | countries_ref        | table | postgres | 888 kB  | 
 covid  | us_aggregated        | table | postgres | 60 MB   | 
(3 rows)
```

We also calculate logarithm of the number of active cases and write it to InfluxDB time-series "active_log".

## Worldmap Panel

First, we visualize the number of confirmed cases across the US regions using Worldmap panel.
This panel is a tile map that can be overlaid with circles representing data points from a query.
It needs two sources of data: a location (latitude and longitude) and data that has link to a location.

The screenshot below shows the configuration settings we used.

As the result we obtain the following map.
